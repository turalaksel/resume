# Academic CV

You can preview the CV as a [PDF](https://geoffboeing.com/share/cv-gboeing.pdf).

This repo contains [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/)'s **LaTeX academic CV**, permissively licensed for others to adapt. The CV content and formatting generally conform to Karen Kelsky's [guidelines](https://theprofessorisin.com/) with tweaks for clearer information presentation and better typography.

The CV's TeX file is **automatically compiled** to PDF and published whenever a commit is pushed to the master branch, via this [workflow](https://github.com/gboeing/cv/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml). This keeps the publicly distributed PDF up-to-date while avoiding commit history pollution from frequent changes to a binary file.
